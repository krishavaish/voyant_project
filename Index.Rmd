**Tool 1: Frequency Comparison**
  The advent of the industrial revolution brought about major changes in the economic and social spheres of everyday life. More specifically, after the liberation movements in 1848, we expected Dickens’ writing to reflect the current situation through more mentions about the repercussions of the industrial revolution in daily life. For example, a greater divide between the classes and thus increased mentions in his books published 1848 onwards. To check for this, we piped together different search terms that encapsulate the upper and lower classes:

madam|master*|mistress*|lady|lord*|vicar|begging|poor|peasant*|orphan*|servant*|charity|workhouse*|union*|poverty

<iframe style='width: 509px; height: 381px;' src='https://voyant-tools.org/tool/Trends/?query=madam%7Cmaster*%7Cmistress*%7Clady%7Clord*%7Cvicar%7Cbegging%7Cpoor%7Cpeasant*%7Corphan*%7Cservant*%7Ccharity%7Cworkhouse*%7Cunion*%7Cpoverty&corpus=e1ff4a9aaff9690c55ac866c468bdc86' data-external='1'></iframe>

  The graph sees its peak in the 1851 book, A Child’s History of England. The book is a commentary about the past English monarchs, the popish clergy, and the violence that took place in the past. The book is about the different societal classes and thus will have a higher mention of words pertaining to class (Jann 199). Additionally, Oliver Twist has the second highest frequency of these terms, as it is a socially accurate portrayal of the social classes in Victorian society. This, too, corresponds with the Poor Law that was ratified in 1834 (Dickens: Law and Politics), that set up workhouses, in which lower class individuals were made to work and live in deplorable conditions. The effects of this law were seen in the few years after its implementation, following which Oliver Twist was published, in 1838. The concept of workhouses and devastating poverty were central to the novel. Consequently, one can conclude that this functions as an allegorical response to the political and social realities of Britain in the 1830s and 40s.

  Interestingly, Great Expectations (1961) had the second lowest frequency of these terms. A haunting and desolate portrayal of Victorian class mobility, this novel based on Dickens’ own childhood experiences is primarily focused on the psychological growth and development that comes from rapid class mobility (Bowen). A very sparsely event-based novel, the extensive examination of psychology and thought patterns reflected the low frequency of terms that was observed, despite the thematic elements of the book representing the class structure of Victorian society.

  Industrialisation also brought with it a change in the mindset of people, of how they perceive money and their feelings towards it. To measure this we searched:

pride*|greed*|passion*|envy*|desire*|wealth*

<iframe style='width: 509px; height: 381px;' src='https://voyant-tools.org/tool/Trends/?query=pride*%7Cgreed*%7Cpassion*%7Cenvy*%7Cdesire*%7Cwealth*&corpus=e1ff4a9aaff9690c55ac866c468bdc86' data-external='1'></iframe>

  This graph also shows no significant pattern, with its highest point in A Christmas Carol, a book about human goodness and benevolence. The book talks about the virtues of kindness and compassion, and thus also mentioned the opposite end of the spectrum (pride and greed).

  The industrial revolution resulted in the exploitation of the lower class (). Children were forced to work in factories and workhouses from a very young age, not even receiving their entire education. A situation Dickens himself personally experienced. We created a cluster of words that assess this situation:
  
hungry|tired|starving|homeless|death|orphanage|workhouse|labour||squalor|polish*|wage*|meagre|misery

<iframe style='width: 509px; height: 381px;' src='https://voyant-tools.org/tool/Trends/?query=hungry%7Ctired%7Cstarving%7Chomeless%7Cdeath%7Corphanage%7Cworkhouse%7Clabour%7C%7Csqualor%7Cpolish*%7Cwage*%7Cmeagre%7Cmisery&corpus=e1ff4a9aaff9690c55ac866c468bdc86' data-external='1'></iframe>

We also searched for words closely related with the processes of industrialisation to see how their usage had changed:

factory|work*|wealth*|industry|production|machine*

<iframe style='width: 509px; height: 381px;' src='https://voyant-tools.org/tool/Trends/?query=factory%7Cwork*%7Cwealth*%7Cindustry%7Cproduction%7Cmachine*&corpus=e1ff4a9aaff9690c55ac866c468bdc86' data-external='1'></iframe>

  All clusters present a random trend from which no meaningful conclusion can be drawn about how Dickens’ writing style changed after the revolution hit its peak in 1848, the liberation movement. The top most frequent words, “mr”, “said”, “little” etc., also do not tell us anything about how industrialisation might have affected his writing, if at all.

<iframe style='width: 509px; height: 381px;' src='https://voyant-tools.org/tool/CorpusTerms/?corpus=e1ff4a9aaff9690c55ac866c468bdc86' data-external='1'></iframe>

  In the examination and presentation of the statistical trends that emerge when the literature of Charles Dickens is analysed, the advent of industrialization, and the liberation movement across Europe, saw a change in the thematic elements that came to define his books. There is a lack of congruence in the results when word frequency of relevant, thematic words is analysed. This implies that the allegorical manner of writing does not capture the increasing thematic focus on the horrors of industrialization, child labour, and the growing class divide.
